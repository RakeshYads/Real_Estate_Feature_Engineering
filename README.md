# Real_Estate_Feature_Engineering🕵️‍♂️👨‍💻👨‍🔧
This repository explores feature engineering techniques and machine learning steps tailored for real estate analysis and prediction. From data preprocessing to model evaluation, the project aims to enhance the predictive power of real estate models through systematic feature engineering and robust machine learning practices.

### Key Components:

   - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Techniques to handle missing data, outliers, and normalization suitable for real estate datasets.

   - Feature Selection: Strategies to identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to predictive models accuracy and interpretability.

   - Feature Engineering: Transforming raw real estate data into meaningful features that capture domain knowledge and enhance model performance.

   - Model Development: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to predict real estate prices or other relevant metrics.

   - Evaluation and Optimization: Metrics and techniques to evaluate model performance, including cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretation.

### Usage:

 1. Clone the Repository:

    ```bash
    
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-feature-engineering.git
